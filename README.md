# LinkOff - LinkedIn Filter and Customizer 🧹

LinkOff cleans and customizes LinkedIn. It filters out the junk, leaving behind the posts and page elements that you want to see.

## Frequently Asked Questions

> Are you going to make a Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey script?

Unfortunately, no. I do not have time to maintain any more code.

> What about Vivaldi/Brave/Edge/Opera and other browsers?

The extension can be natively installed on all chromium browsers.

> What about Safari and MacOs?

The store charges 100$ per year to post apps, which I cannot afford.

> How can I use this on mobile?

Since neither Chrome or Firefox allow for extensions in mobile browsers, you need to install a chromium distribution that does. I recommend Kiwi Browser (if you have any issues, please report them, still testing mobile support).

## Contributing

Please create an issue before submitting a pull request.

Use `yarn` to install dependencies. To build the CSS from SCSS run `yarn css-build`.

You can also trigger the build on changes by running the watcher with  `yarn start`

To install the extension locally follow the instructions below for your browser.

**Firefox**

- Type `about:debugging` in the Firefox URL bar and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
- Click **This Firefox** on the left, and then **Load Temporary Add-on…**
- Navigate to the location of the folder you unzipped, select the `manifest.json` file inside

**Chromium**

- Type `chrome://extensions` in the Chrome URL bar and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
- Enable **Developer mode** using the toggle on the right
- Click **Load Unpacked** on the left side of the window
- Navigate to the location of the folder you unzipped, and click **Select Folder**

### Commit message format

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body**, and a **footer**.

```
<header>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The `<header>` format should be as follows:

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
  │       │             │
  │       │             └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
  │       │
  │       └─⫸ Commit Scope: common|home|feed|messages|jobs|misc... or empty
  │
  └─⫸ Commit Type: feat|fix|perf
```

#### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

#### Type

If the prefix is `feat`, `fix` or `perf`, it will appear in the changelog. However if there is any [BREAKING CHANGE](#footer), the commit will always appear in the changelog.

#### Subject

The subject contains succinct description of the change:

- use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- don't capitalize first letter
- no dot (.) at the end

#### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

#### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.
